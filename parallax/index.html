    <p class="left">“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'<br>
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.<br>
'I don't much care where -' said Alice.<br>
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.<br>
'- so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.<br>
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.”</p>
